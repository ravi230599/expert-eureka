#You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

# Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
# Explanation: The linked-lists are:
# [
#   1->4->5,
#   1->3->4,
#   2->6
# ]
# merging them into one sorted list:
# 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
